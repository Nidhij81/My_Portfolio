            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am Nidhi Joshi ðŸ‘‹ â€” a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst with a strong foundation in turning raw data into meaningful insights. With over 6 years of experience in client-facing and analytical roles, Iâ€™ve developed a sharp eye for uncovering trends, solving business problems, and communicating data stories that drive decisions.
                ðŸ’¡ My toolkit includes:
                SQL â€“ crafting complex queries to clean, transform, and analyze large datasets
                Power BI â€“ building interactive dashboards and visualizations that bring data to life
                Excel â€“ advanced formulas, pivot tables, and automation for streamlined reporting
                Python â€“ applying data analysis, automation, and exploratory techniques
                I enjoy bridging the gap between data and decision-making, simplifying complexity, and empowering stakeholders with insights they can trust. Whether itâ€™s optimizing performance, spotting hidden opportunities, or tracking KPIs, I thrive on solving problems with data-driven strategies.When Iâ€™m not working with data, youâ€™ll find me exploring new tools in the analytics space, staying curious about how AI is shaping the future of data, and continuously upgrading my skills to stay ahead.
                âœ¨ My mission: To help businesses harness the full potential of their data and transform it into actionable intelligence.
